# Ten Tips for an Effective Presentation

Your presentation isn’t about your slides alone. It’s about the message you want to get across. Approach this like an argument that you're trying to win. Start the beginning and lead the listener through it step by step, like a story.
## 1. Develop Your PowerPoint Presentation’s ‘Thesis’
Right now, before you get any further in the process, write out what your topic is about in one sentence. This single-sentence “thesis” must be specific, relevant, and debatable. You'll spend the rest of your presentation proving this argument.
## 2. Highlight What’s Most Important
Make a list. Jot down everything that comes to mind on your topic. Once you’ve done this, go back through the list and highlight (or circle or underline) the points that are most important. If you only had five to six main points to persuade a listener to agree with your opinion, which points would you choose? 
## 3. Write it Out
Now all you need to do is organize the points in a logical way. “Storyboard” or script the entire presentation to give you an idea of how the information presented will “flow,” and how viewers will see it in sequence. 
## 4. Rehearse! (Yes, Already)
It’s never too early to get used to the rhythm of your presentation and take note of points you want to emphasize. While saying it out loud, you’ll start to develop a “feel” for the material and notice that some things work well, while others don’t and might need to be worked around.
## 5.  Keep Your Slides Simple
Keep in mind that less is more (effective). A cluttered slide is distracting. A headline, a few bullet points, an image – too much more than that and you risk losing your audience as they sort it all out. A simple, visually appealing slide will engage your audience, keeping them on track with your main points. 

## 6.  Limit words
Slides are a poor medium for detail and reading. Avoid paragraphs, quotations and even complete sentences. The audience will be able to digest and retain key points more easily. The audience should be listening, not reading. (Humans can’t read and listen at the same time). 
PowerPoint and other presentation software have functions to display notes onto the presenter’s screen that do not get sent to the projector, or you can use notecards, a separate document, or your memory. 
## 7. Format wisely
Standardize position, colors, and styles. Stick to sans-serif fonts for legibility (examples: Arial, Calibri, Helvetica). If you’re using a dark background, make the text bold for readability. Minimum of 18-point fonts, 20 to 24 is better - even larger for headings. A single contrasting color can be used to emphasize important points in your text, but use color with care. 
## 8. Use Accurate and Relevant Charts and Graphs
Charts and graphs can also be distracting if they’re not used right. Make sure your information design is simple and clean so that the audience doesn’t spend the entire time trying to decipher what your X axis says. 
## 9. Expect Technical Difficulties
Plan on your technology breaking down. If it hasn’t happened to you yet, it will at some point. What will you do? Will your presentation still make sense? Have a backup plan for delivering the presentation in case something goes wrong. 
## 10. Use “Present Mode” When Rehearsing
When you finally are ready to hit the `Present` button in PowerPoint, make sure you use the `Present Mode` option. This allows for you (and only you) to view additional notes about each slide—just in case you forget something!
