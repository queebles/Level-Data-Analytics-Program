*WHAT IS AN ABSTRACT?*

The abstract is a one-paragraph summary of the capstone project, typically between 150 and 250 words. It is a scholarly version of the “elevator pitch,” a scenario in which you have one minute in an elevator to answer someone's question about what your project was about and what you were hoping to do. 

The unifying theme on any analytics project is working through the entire data science workflow, from discovering a problem you’d like to solve, identifying a data set, working through the data files, going through statistics and hypotheses, showcasing visualizations about what the data means, applying the algorithms that might be relevant for that problem, and explaining the metrics in the business case presentation. The abstract encapsulates all of the central ideas of your project, including what you did and what you found. It's certainly not comprehensive or all-inclusive; it is a concise summary of the key points of your analysis.

*TEMPLATE*

**PURPOSE:** An opening statement on the topic and general introduction of the problem, including relevant background information. The first sentence usually is something meant to gather the attention of the reader. State what the project is about, what you hope to demonstrate, the significance of the project, how did this idea come about (optional), what kind of sources/theoretical framework you will be using to analyze your questions (if applicable). You could even begin with "the purpose of this study was/is to…."

**PROCEDURE:** Describe the conceptual framework, data collection and analysis process, methodology and/or research design. This is often a good place to mention participants/population; sample size, and inclusion criteria. You may use a variety of approaches, ranging from textual analysis to statistical analysis, from hypothesis testing to machine learning techniques, and so on. You should demonstrate that you know not only what methods you employ, but the strengths and weaknesses of these methods. 

**OUTCOME:** Choose a few key findings to highlight here as the “hook” (main message/finding) of the project. In the abstract it is not possible to summarize all of the results of the study, but you want to bring out those most important conclusions -- or the most important results, the most meaningful ones. If the project is not yet complete, focus instead on the primary variables that you plan to use in your analysis and what you hope to achieve.

**IMPACT:** Summarize final recommendations, conclusions, and/or implications. Any recommendations for change should be grounded in some kind of tangible outcome or improvement that affects individuals, organizations, cultures, societies. In general, you want to avoid making broad claims that are not likely to be achieved. A good impact statement articulates who might apply your findings and how they might do that. If the project is not yet complete, focus on major stakeholders and what they might gain from your analysis.
